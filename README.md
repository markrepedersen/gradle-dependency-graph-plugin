# gradle-dependency-graph-plugin
A simple plugin that will generate a .png dependency graph for all Gradle tasks.

I coded this to use in some other projects and also as a POC for a work-related project that was using Gradle.
This lets you visualize relatively complex task dependencies (ones that have many, many finalizer and dependencies).
This was also a made since all the other task dependency graph plugins were very disappointing and lacked sufficient features.
